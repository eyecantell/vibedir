Lets talk software design for a python CLI project. I have a project called vibedir that will help devleopers work with an LLM. It will consist of a menu-style CLI that will need to maintain/determine state between sessions (particularly for the items listed in teh CLI header). I want to stub out the UI so that I can continue the design with a skeletal prototype to use, but first I want to talk design.  I am providing the overview in vibedir.md and an example dev.md for context.
