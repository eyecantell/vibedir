# VibeDir - Functionality is not yet ready, but "COMING SOON" #

VibeDir is a utility to facilitate code modifications when using an AI assistant. By integrating with `prepdir` and `applydir`, it generates prompts for large language models to modify a codebase. VibeDir supports manual workflows and in the future will support API integration with the latest GenAI models.

# Todo
- Developer profile (dev.md)
- Development guidelines (dont reinvent the wheel)
- Build prompt (including applydir format)
- Git integration (commit each change so can be reverted, flatten on pr?)
- Add status items to exmaple menu

# Functionality is not yet ready, but "COMING SOON" #

## Features
- Generate prompts for code changes based on `prepped_dir.txt` from `prepdir`.
- Support manual editing or API-driven workflows.
- Configurable via a YAML file for custom prompt templates and logging.

## Installation
```bash
# Will be pip install vibedir but don't do it yet!
```

## Usage
1. TBD

## Configuration
VibeDir uses a `config.yaml` file for settings. Example:
```yaml
logging:
  level: INFO
prompt_template: |
  You are a code modification assistant. Attached is the content of a prepped_dir.txt file generated by prepdir, listing files and additional commands for a project. Your task is to apply the following changes: {user_request}. Return the modified content in a file named modified_prepped_dir.txt, preserving the original format, including delimiters (e.g., =-=, ===---===), file markers (Begin File, End File), and additional commands section. Ensure filenames in Begin File and End File markers match exactly, and only include valid code changes.

  === prepped_dir.txt Content ===
  {prepped_dir_content}
  === End prepped_dir.txt Content ===

  Output the modified content as modified_prepped_dir.txt with the same structure.
```

## Development
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eyecantell/vibedir`
- Install with PDM: `pdm install -G test`
- Run tests: `pdm run pytest`
- Build and publish: `pdm build && pdm publish`

## Contributing
Issues and PRs are welcome at [https://github.com/eyecantell/vibedir](https://github.com/eyecantell/vibedir).

## Git Integration
- Managed by `vibedir` to keep `applydir` focused.
- **Before Validation**: Commit (e.g., `git commit -m "Pre-applydir changes"`) or backup files.
- **After Application**: Commit approved changes or revert (e.g., `git reset --hard`).
- **Non-Git Projects**: Use file backups.
