# VibeDir - Functionality is not yet ready, but "COMING SOON" #

VibeDir is a utility to facilitate code modifications when using an AI assistant. It generates prompts for large language models to modify a codebase. VibeDir supports manual workflows (clipboard mode) and in the future will support API integration with the latest GenAI models.

## Overview  
`vibedir` enables **clipboard-driven UI** and **API-powered automation** for LLM development.
- Two modes of operation:  
  - **Clipboard**: Human-in-loop cut/paste to LLM UI (e.g. Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, other)
  - **API**: Uses `apibump` (LiteLLM wrapper) for scripted calls and usage charges.
