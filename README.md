# VibeDir

VibeDir is a utility to facilitate code modifications when using an AI assistant. By integrating with `prepdir` and `applydir`, it generates prompts for large language models (like Grok 3) to modify a codebase. VibeDir supports manual workflows and in the future will support API integration with the latest GenAI models.

# Functionality is not yet ready, but "COMING SOON" #

## Features
- Generate prompts for code changes based on `prepped_dir.txt` from `prepdir`.
- Support manual editing or API-driven workflows.
- Configurable via a YAML file for custom prompt templates and logging.

## Installation
```bash
# Will be pip install vibedir but don't do it yet!
```

## Usage
1. TBD

## Configuration
VibeDir uses a `config.yaml` file for settings. Example:
```yaml
logging:
  level: INFO
prompt_template: |
  You are a code modification assistant. Below is the content of a prepped_dir.txt file generated by prepdir, listing files and additional commands for a project. Your task is to apply the following changes: {user_request}. Return the modified content in a file named modified_prepped_dir.txt, preserving the original format, including delimiters (e.g., =-=, ===---===), file markers (Begin File, End File), and additional commands section. Ensure filenames in Begin File and End File markers match exactly, and only include valid code changes.

  === prepped_dir.txt Content ===
  {prepped_dir_content}
  === End prepped_dir.txt Content ===

  Output the modified content as modified_prepped_dir.txt with the same structure.
```
